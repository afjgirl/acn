            </div>
            <p>Steve Drakoulis is a father of two wonderful children, one of whom has High Functioning Autism.
                <br><br> He has been working in autism support roles for many years, initially as a volunteer, before moving full time into roles supporting families with an autism spectrum disorder.
                <br><br> He has 20 years’ experience in senior management roles, mainly in the service industry, and holds an Advanced Diploma in Management and a Diploma in Community Services Work. He is also an experienced trainer and facilitator, with
                a Certificate IV in Training and Assessment.
                <br><br> He became involved in autism support work following years of learning all he could to better support his son. As a stay home dad, he joined support groups, did courses, and took on volunteer work with organisations such as Autism
                Spectrum Australia (Aspect) and Learning Links. He has also served on every P&C or management committee at schools and preschools his children have attended. In 2010, he was offered the role of facilitator for the Bankstown region with
                the Positive Partnerships program. This federally funded program required him to help that community set up two support groups and help them learn how to better advocate for their children.
                <br><br> He created this website initially as a means to preserve all the useful information he had gained during his time in that role.
                <br><br> Following his success at Bankstown, he was offered the same role with Positive Partnerships for the Northern Beaches. When that ended, he was appointed to the St. George area, and by 2014 he had been contracted to the role (of
                Key Local Facilitator) 7 times for different regions around Sydney.

                    <p class="text-muted">International Lions Clubs<br>Medal of Merit</p>
                </div>
                From his early days with Positive Partnerships, a network of families had begun to grow. They used the website and attended support groups Steve was facilitating around Sydney.
                <br><br> In 2011, Steve was nominated for an award at Aspect for his work with Positive Partnerships. With interviews on Sydney radio and word of mouth about the support groups, the Autism Community Network was taking greater shape.
                <br><br> At the start of 2011, 66 families were using the ACN. At the start of 2012, this number had grown to over 200. With the wonderful support of families in our network, the ACN. was registered as a not for profit organisation in
                October 2011. It gained Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status by the ATO and has also been recognised as a charity. As of 26 November, we have over 1000 families registered.
                <br><br> We have only one objective – to help parents, children and adults on the autism spectrum, through our own capacity as parents and carers.
                <br><br> Steve is proud of the fact that parents never have to pay to access ACN support. While he works full time to manage the organisation, he is only paid part time while he and the team work to bring the ACN to a stronger financial
                situation.
